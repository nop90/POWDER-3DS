Powder Customized Tiles (NetHack) 1.2 by Widar

These are repainted tiles taken from artpack 045.
They now look like those of NetHack.

Improved some monsters and objects (look at baezl'bub now).

Use it how you like the most. Distribute them if you want. I simply ask that you put the credits (if you like them), or nothing (if you don't).

Maybe i'll improve them. Suggestions are well accepted.
