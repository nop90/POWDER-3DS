IBSON THE GREY'S POWDER TILESET (32x32) v107

This tileset was designed by Ibson the Grey (a.k.a. Craig Judy) Part
of the graphic tiles used in this program are from the public domain
roguelike tileset "RLTiles". Nearly all of the tiles have been
modified by Ibson the Grey.

You can find the original tileset at:     http://rltiles.sf.net

To use in powder, place the files into a GFX directory in the main
powder directory. The option for 'From Disk' will then appear in the
'Tiles' menu under 'Options'.

Enjoy!
