The development of POWDER has been influenced, both directly and
indirectly, from many sources.

This document is by no means exhaustive.  The release notes for the
individual versions is likely more complete.

:Special Notes:
---------------

Adam Bolt: Unsurprisingly, the tiles in the Adam Bolt tileset came
from Adam Bolt's tileset.

Akoi Meexx: The Akoi Meexx tileset, which is now the default POWDER
tileset.

Andrea Menga (Widar): The Nethackish Tileset.

Bill Blake: The PS3 Port

Ben Shadwick: Another use for bottles of water, skill level
notification, and many other valuable suggestions.

Casey Robinson: [Select] to do a one time command on Start menu.

Darshan Shaligram: Character Dump option.

David Parker: Port of POWDER to the GP2X.

Emanuel Schleussinger: Creator of HAM, the library for the GBA that
made this much, much, easier.

Erik Piper: Numerous UI suggestions for both SDL and GBA versions which 
I used.

Gottardo Zancani (Zak): Binding [L] and [R] buttons.  Cool maps.
Compiling the Adam Bolt tilesets.

Hansjorg Malthaner: Sunfire Spell.

Ilya Kasnacheev: WinCE port.

Igor D. WonderLlama: Second ascension post on rec.games.roguelike.misc (063).

Kantaphon Tongmee: Discussion on god code.

Kelly Bailey: The ASCII Tileset.

Lauri Vallo: First [POWDER] post on rec.games.roguelike.misc.  First
ascension post on rec.games.roguelike.misc.  Inspirational rumours for
the Blue Dragon Cavern.  Now all I need are fortune cookies of some
sort...

Markus Maier: Bevy of font redesigns.

Marvin Sanchez: Port of POWDER to PSP.

R. Alan Monroe: Suggestions for UI improvements.  Most of which I
haven't used, but know that I should.  (One day I'll get around to
proportional fonts...)

R. Dan Henry: Reminding me the inventory screen is ugly.

Richard Quirk: Submitted (the first) code patches for improved DS
behaviour.

5parrow: Mouse movement algorithm on rec.games.roguelike.nethack.

Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto: The most excellent Mersenne
Twister.

:Influential Games:

Nethack

The first roguelike I played.  POWDER seeks to build a similar world
of interoperability, where one can say "The dev team thought of
everything!"  Seeks is the operative word here.

ADOM

While my introduction to Nethack was a finished game, I had the chance
to play ADOM as it evolved.  This gave a good insight into the
development process.

Crawl

Started POWDER without having played this.  However, when I returned
to the roguelike newsgroups after many years absence, I found everyone
talking about Crawl.  From what I've read, for good reasons.  Thus,
I've read up on spoilers for Crawl, seeking always the key pieces of
game design that can be lifted into POWDER.  Sticky Flames, for
example, comes from here.  After playing Crawl for a bit, I also was
motivated to change the shadow code to highlight LOS.
