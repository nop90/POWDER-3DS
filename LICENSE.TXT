Note

The Adam Bolt tileset are copyright by Adam Bolt and are licensed
separately.  Other tilesets are creations of the respective creators -
download the latest artpack for details.

MSVCP71.DLL and MSVCR71.DLL are owned and licensed entirely by
Microsoft.  They are redistributed with POWDER as per their edicts.  I'd
rather not have to include them.

Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library is licensed under the GNU
Lesser General Public License (LGPL).  POWDER conforms to the third
clause - where you downloaded this should also have been a link to
download a source tarball.

Execution
---------
You are allowed to execute the POWDER binary, either by running it in
an emulator or on hardware.

Duplication
-----------
You are allowed to duplicate the POWDER distribution provided you:
1) Keep the distribution intact.  This means keeping this license.
2) Do not charge for the act of duplication, nor for the medium of
duplication above the rate which you paid to acquire it.
3) Do not add to the distribution in a manner which obscures the
original author.
4) Do not modify the POWDER binary nor accompanying files.  This
includes, but is not limited to, the removal of any licensing or
copyright information embedded in the files.

An exception is made when duplicating to a cartridge or similar device
for purpose of executing the binary on hardware.  In this case, the
binary alone needs to be duplicated (as that is all that is practical)
An exception is made for patching the binary to run on certain
platforms.

Transfer
--------
You are free to transfer copies of POWDER to others, provided they
remain unaltered, and the transfer is performed without payment.  You
are encouraged to instead show people to the author's current web site
where the latest version may be acquired.

Reverse Engineering
-------------------
You are strongly discouraged from reverse engingeering the POWDER
binary.  If you have questions about how an algorithm worked, contact
the author who will likely freely answer.  If would like the source,
check the download site where it is available.

Disclaimer
----------
Neither the author, nor anyone associated with the distribution of
this binary to your system, is responsible for any damage done to your
computer, console, or handheld.  This includes, but is not limited
to, loss of data, work, time, or hardware.  

In some, or all, places, a limitation of liability may not be
possible.  It is your responsibility to verify that within your
jurisdiction the above disclaimer fully exempts the author from all
liability.  If it does not, all earlier rights of execution,
duplication, and transfer are rescinded.

ALL CAPS
--------
THIS SECTION OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT IS WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS TO MAKE
IT APPEAR MORE LEGAL.  IT ISN'T.  INSTEAD, IT IS JUST A FRIENDLY
REMINDER TO ENJOY POWDER AND TO CONTACT THE AUTHOR IF YOU PLAY IT.
EVEN IF YOU HATE THE GAME.  POWDER IS A LABOUR OF LOVE WHICH HAS PAID
FOR ITSELF IN THE AUTHOR'S OWN ENJOYMENT, YET THERE IS NO REASON WHY
IT CANNOT EARN EVEN MORE DIVIDENDS OF HAPPINESS BY BRINGING JOY TO THE
LIVES OF OTHERS.
